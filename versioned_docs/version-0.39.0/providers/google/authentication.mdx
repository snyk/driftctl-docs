title: Authentication
---

To use driftctl, we need credentials to make authenticated requests to your GCP project.

:::info service account
Since driftctl use Cloud Asset API, using a service account is **mandatory**.
:::

Please refer to [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) to setup a proper service account.

```shell
$ GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=your-creds.json\
  CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project\
  driftctl scan --to gcp+tf
```

You can use any env var from [google cloud sdk environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties#setting_properties_via_environment_variables).

## Least privileged policy

driftctl uses [Google Asset API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudasset.googleapis.com/overview) to enumerate efficiently resources on your account.
It also uses [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com) to enumerate project IAM Resources.
Be sure to have enabled these APIs for the GCP project you are using.

To be able to enumerate resources, you need at least the role [Cloud Asset Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloud-asset-roles).

:::info deep mode
If you want to use driftctl with deep mode, driftctl will also need to retrieve resource's details and the **Cloud Asset Viewer** will not be enough.
If you want to be able to get the details you should set up the basic role [Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#basic-definitions) on your project.
To read your IAM policies you will also need role [iam.securityReviewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam-roles) on your project.
