title: Authentication
---

To use driftctl, we need credentials to make authenticated requests to GitHub. Just like the terraform provider, we retrieve config from [environment variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs#argument-reference).

```shell
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=14758f1afd44c09b7992073ccf00b43d\
  GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=my-org\
  driftctl scan --to github+tf
```

## Least privileged policy

Below you can find the minimal scope required for driftctl to be able to scan every GitHub supported resources.

```shell
# Required to enumerate private repos
repo

# Required to list your organization teams
# and other organization related resources
read:org
```

:::info repository permissions
Beware that if you don't set permission `repo` for your token, you won't see any errors for repositories listing.
**Thus, all private repositories will appear as deleted from remote.**
