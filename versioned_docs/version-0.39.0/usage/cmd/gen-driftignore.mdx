Some people do not have the goal of reaching a 100% IAC coverage with their infrastructure. And for them, driftctl can be annoying to continuously deliver drift notifications on resources they don't care. For this use case, there's a solution.

You can start using driftctl with a clean state, by ignoring all the current resources that are not yet under control. driftctl provides a command to automatically generate a .driftignore file from a previous scan given the type of resources you want to exclude (e.g. unmanaged, missing or changed resources). This command parses a JSON input from a given file and sends output to stdout.

```shell
# Append all current drift to .driftignore
$ driftctl scan -o json://stdout | driftctl gen-driftignore

# Print proposed driftignore based on all current drift to stdout
$ driftctl scan -o json://stdout | driftctl gen-driftignore -o -

# Changed resources will be excluded
$ driftctl scan --from tfstate://state1.tfstate -o json://stdout | driftctl gen-driftignore --exclude-changed

# Unmanaged resources will be excluded
# In this example, we use a file as an intermediate step instead of piping into
# gen-driftignore
$ driftctl scan --from tfstate://state1.tfstate -o json://result.json
$ driftctl gen-driftignore -i result.json --exclude-unmanaged
```

You can filter which kind of resource you want to ignore using these flags:

- `--exclude-unmanaged` : Exclude resources not managed by IaC
- `--exclude-missing` : Exclude resources missing on cloud provider
- `--exclude-changed` : Exclude resources that changed from IaC

## Using Docker

Run a scan with JSON output enabled:

```
$ docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v ~/.driftctl:/root/.driftctl \
  -e AWS_PROFILE=driftctl-demo \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  snyk/driftctl scan --from tfstate://**/*.tfstate --output json://drifts.json
[...]
```

Finally, generate the `.driftignore` file from the JSON:

```
$ docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v ~/.driftctl:/root/.driftctl \
  -e AWS_PROFILE=driftctl-demo \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  snyk/driftctl gen-driftignore -i drifts.json
[...]
```
