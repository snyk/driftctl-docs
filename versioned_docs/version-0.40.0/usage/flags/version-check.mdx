title: Version Check
---

By default, driftctl checks for a new version remotely. The request to the remote server might send the following data about your computer:

- **IP Address**
- **OS** (e.g.: linux, darwin, windows)
- **Arch** (e.g.: amd64, i386)

To disable this behavior, either use the flag `--no-version-check` or define the environment variable `DCTL_NO_VERSION_CHECK`.
