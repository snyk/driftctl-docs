By default, driftctl sends telemetry data to help us improve the product.
You can find below a sample of what data are collected by driftctl.

```json
{
    "version": "0.7.1",
    "os": "linux",
    "arch": "amd64",
    "total_resources": 100,
    "total_managed": 10,
    "duration": 300 // analysis time in seconds
}
```

To disable this behavior, either use the flag `--disable-telemetry` or define the environment variable `DCTL_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`.
