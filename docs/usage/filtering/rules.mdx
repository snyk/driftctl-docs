:::info
Filter rules can be used not only to **scan** resources, but also to **ignore** resources.

You can indeed use both inclusion and exclusion logics.
:::

**Filter rules** allow you to build complex expression to include and exclude a set of resources in your workflow.
Powered by expression language [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) you could build a complex include and exclude expression.

Filter rules could be passed to `scan` cmd with `--filter` flag.
You could also use the environment variable `DCTL_FILTER`.
Filter rules syntax in use is actually [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/specification.html).

Filter are applied on a normalized struct which contains the following fields:

- **Type**: Type of the resource, e.g. `aws_s3_bucket`
- **Id**: Id of the resource, e.g. `my-bucket-name`
- **Attr**: Contains every resource attributes (check `pkg/resource/aws/aws_s3_bucket.go` for a full list of supported attributes of a bucket)

:::caution
If you want to filter on `Attr` you should enable deep mode otherwise you will not have access to resource's details.

### Examples

```shell
# Will include only S3 bucket in the search
$ driftctl scan --filter "Type=='aws_s3_bucket'"
# OR (beware of escape your shell special chars between double quotes)
$ driftctl scan --filter $'Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\''

# Excludes only s3 bucket named 'my-bucket-name'
$ driftctl scan --filter $'Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\' && Id!=\'my-bucket-name\''

# Ignore buckets that have tags terraform equal to 'false'
$ driftctl scan --deep --filter $'!(Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\' && Attr.tags.terraform==\'false\')'

# Ignore buckets that don't have tag terraform
$ driftctl scan --deep --filter $'!(Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\' && Attr.tags != null && !contains(keys(Attr.tags), \'terraform\'))'

# Ignore buckets with an ID prefix of 'terraform-'
$ driftctl scan --filter $'!(Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\' && starts_with(Id, \'terraform-\'))'

# Ignore buckets with an ID suffix of '-test'
$ driftctl scan --filter $'!(Type==\'aws_s3_bucket\' && ends_with(Id, \'-test\'))'

# Ignore GitHub archived repositories
driftctl scan --to github+tf --deep --filter '!(Attr.Archived)'
```
