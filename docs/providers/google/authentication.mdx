title: Authentication
---

To use driftctl, we need credentials to make authenticated requests to your GCP project.

:::info service account
Since driftctl use Cloud Asset API, using a service account is **mandatory**.
:::

Please refer to [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) to setup a proper service account.

```shell
$ GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=your-creds.json\
  CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project\
  driftctl scan --to gcp+tf
```

You can use any env var from [google cloud sdk environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties#setting_properties_via_environment_variables).

## Least privileged policy

driftctl uses [Google Asset API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudasset.googleapis.com/overview) to enumerate efficiently resources on your account.
Be sure to have enabled it for the GCP project you are using.

To be able to enumerate resources, you need at least the role [Cloud Asset Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloud-asset-roles).

:::info deep mode
If you want to use driftctl with deep mode, driftctl will also need to retrieve resource's details and the **Cloud Asset Viewer** will not be enough.
If you want to be able to get the details you should set up the basic role [Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#basic-definitions) on your project.
:::

### Required roles

```
# Mandatory role to allow driftctl to enumerate resources
roles/cloudasset.viewer

# Required for deep mode only
roles/viewer
```
